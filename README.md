The Hospital Program is a C++ console application that simulates the functionalities of a hospital. It allows users to interact with different modules such as Outpatient 
Department (OPD), Inpatient Department (IPD), Emergency, and the Hospital Pharmacy. Patients can provide personal information, choose doctors, select bed types, and even visit the 
cafeteria.


Features:
1. Modular Structure: The system is divided into OPD, IPD, Emergency, and Pharmacy modules, each with specific functionalities.
2. Patient Information: Capture patient details, including name, age, mobile number, and insurance coverage.
3. Doctor Selection (OPD): Choose a specific type of doctor, with associated fees.
4. Bed Selection (IPD): Select bed types (Private, Twin Sharing, Multibed) with corresponding charges.
5. Emergency Services: Capture details of emergency cases and generate receipts.
6. Pharmacy (Generic Implementation): Under construction, but placeholders are available.
7. Cafeteria Services: Patients can order food or drinks from the cafeteria.
